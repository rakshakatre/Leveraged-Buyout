# Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Financial Model

## Overview
This project is a leveraged buyout (LBO) financial model built in Excel to evaluate the acquisition of a target company using significant debt financing.  
The model analyzes transaction structure, financing mix, projected cash flows, debt repayment capacity, and investor returns over a 5-year investment horizon.

The objective is to determine whether the acquisition meets private equity return thresholds and to estimate Internal Rate of Return (IRR) under base-case assumptions.

## Model Structure

### 1. Transaction Assumptions
- Purchase price and entry multiple  
- Financing structure (debt vs equity)  
- Debt tranches and interest rates  
- Fees and transaction costs  
- Sources & Uses of funds  

### 2. Operating Forecast
Projected operating performance during holding period:
- Revenue growth assumptions  
- EBITDA margins  
- Operating expenses  
- Capital expenditure  
- Working capital changes

### 3. Debt Schedule
Detailed debt modeling including:
- Senior debt balance  
- Mandatory amortization  
- Optional repayments (cash sweep)  
- Interest expense calculation  
- Closing debt balance by year  

---

### 4. Cash Flow & Exit Analysis
- Free cash flow available for debt repayment  
- Cash sweep mechanism  
- Exit year EBITDA projection  
- Exit multiple assumption  
- Enterprise value at exit  
- Equity value at exit

## Returns Analysis

Investor return metrics calculated:

- Equity contribution  
- Equity proceeds at exit  
- Money-on-Money (MoM) multiple  
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)  

The model evaluates whether returns meet typical private equity benchmarks (≈20–25% IRR).
